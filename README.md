The study focuses on a retail dataset from a prominent American multinational corporation, known for its extensive chain of supercenters, discount departmental stores, and grocery outlets. Operating globally with over 100 million customers, the dataset offers valuable insights.

My analysis delves into customer purchase behavior, specifically examining purchase amounts in relation to various factors, including gender. The objective is to provide actionable insights to enhance business decision-making. I aim to understand potential differences in spending habits between male and female customers, such as whether women tend to spend more on occasions like Black Friday.

To address this business problem, I employed statistical tools, including Confidence Interval and Central Limit Theorem (CLT), ensuring a robust and reliable analytical approach.
